Go is a web application server framework. It combines concepts found in the Zope and WO frameworks.

Its unlikely that you want to give it a try, unless you:

1. Like the WO component/templating system
2. Don't want to use WO for whatever reason (otherwise just use WO)
3. Are not interested in 100% exact WO compatibility
4. Find Java as a programming language tolerable
5. Do not expect a shrinkwrapped product

If all that is OK with you, Go, give it a try ;-)
