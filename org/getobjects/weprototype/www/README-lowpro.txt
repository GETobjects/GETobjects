Low Pro is a small JavaScript library built as an extension to Prototype that makes unobtrusive DOM scripting much easier.  Here's a rundown of the functionality:

* Optimsed $$ - function for much fast CSS node selection.
* Extended DOM Methods and DOM Builder - remove(), nextElement(), preciousElement() etc and $p('DOM Builder!') type stuff
* Event.onReady() - add callbacks that execute as soon as the DOM is ready.
* Event.addBehavior() - add behaviors to elements declaritively using CSS selectors.
* Behavior object binding - If you prefer a more OO approach to behaviors Behavior.create() will create a behavior class that you can bind to elements.
* $('element').observe() - event handling methods added to elements.
* callback scope fixed for Event.observe - this always refers to the element in event handlers.
* Event.trigger() - trigger an elements event handlers for a specific event.

Tested in: Firefox 1.5 (PC/Mac), Safari 2, IE 6, Opera 9 (PC/Mac)

This library is based on the work of many great JavaScript programmers:

Dean Edwards, John Resig and Matthias Miller: dom ready work and Dean's addEvent.
Justin Palmer: event:Selectors which is the basis for addBehavior.
Sylvian Zimmer: $$ optimisation.
